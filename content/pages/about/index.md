### Helena Zhang (she/her)


Hey! I'm Helena, a first-year student studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. When not reading- or studying, for that matter- I'm probably either writing or coding in my spare time. I have several years of experience coding minigames in Python and Java, and have begun to pick up some C++. As of more recent, my interests have begun to lean towards web development, so I thought: why not make my own? And thus, this website was born!

My preferred genres are historical fiction and fantasy, though I'll occasionally choose to dabble in other areas as well. Please note that everything in this blog, unless stated otherwise, is representative of solely my own personal opinion. Additionally, updates will likely come at minimum once a month, as I am currently a full-time student and don't have as much free time on my hands as I'd like. 

If you have any questions or book recommendations, please do feel free to reach out! I hope you enjoy this blog as much as I did writing it. Happy reading!
