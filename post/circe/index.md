## SPOILER FREE

### Introduction

People often say the transition to university is tough, but I think that this is one of those things one can really only understand once they experience it for themselves. Between studying, coding, and cooking (whilst adjusting to all the other aspects that came with university and dorm life), I eventually realized that it had been nearly two months since I'd last read anything for pure enjoyment. And it wasn't that I didn't have books available-- there was a pile of books on books-to-read list, unread and practically collecting dust-- or even because I didn't want to, actually. It was that I could barely find the time, let alone the energy, to pick up a book and read.

One Friday night, I was browsing again through my lists, wholly determined to just sit down and read one full book before the day ended. That's when I saw Circe; the recommendation of a friend-- we'd both been huge fans of Percy Jackson and all things Greek mythology, back in the day-- and that's also when I knew: I had to give it a try.

### Thoughts

First. The quotes. *The quotes*. I am such a sucker for authors that drop strong, beautifully written little pieces here and there, and Circe did not disappoint in the slightest. At the risk of spoilers, I will not include them here, but- *the quotes*. I could probably cherrypick at least one from every chapter, and that's not even the least I have to say about this story. 

Second. Before Circe, I'd heard of but had never read any of Madeline Miller's stories-- well, rest assured, I'll be one of the first to any of her new releases in the future. Circe was a story that examined her immortal life; the span of over tens of thousands of years, and yet what I think I admired most was how the authenticity of her emotions never faded, not even for a moment. There was simply so much humanization: Circe was strong because that was who she was and who she was molded to be; she was wise not just because she had lived long, but because she made the mistakes and learned from them. She was not perfect, and she was not good, but she was the culmination of the thousands of years that she had lived, and she was wholly, wonderfully, *complex*. 

### Rating

The prose was absolutely delicious, and the character development was delightful. I was torn on Circe's rating-- hovering between favorite and just 'would read again'-- but eventually decided on would read again, because Circe's narrative at times was not compelling enough for me to form an emotional attachment to the character. However, the book was something I thoroughly enjoyed, and would definitely read again.
